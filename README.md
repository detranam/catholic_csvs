## NOTE

All CSV files have an end of line of \r\n, and their delimiter is always a semicolon (;). The first line is always the header.  
(brk) signifies a line break if you wanted to make these songs look 'pretty', otherwise when parsed you can simply remove all instances of (brk) and replace them with a single space without any confusion.

## General CSV Files

These are a set of files that might be useful for application development for religious (Catholic, most likely) applications. Feel free to use any of them! There's no copyright.

### Saints and Feast Days

This is formatted as: 'Saint;Date;Patronage'

### Marian_Antiphons

This is formatted as: 'Time Sung;Name;Latin;English'

### Common_Prayers_English_Latin
